# 3d-Stars
Inspired by the legacy Windows "Flying Through Space / Stars" screensaver. This Python game transforms the star into a 3D space and lets you walk the galaxy! Use a combination of WSAD and arrow keys to fly around in space. Happy touring. 

`pygame` is a dependcy. To install `pygame` with `pip` do:

`python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

or alternatively, 

`python3 -m pip install pygame`

## To lunch the game, run: `python star_walk.py`
